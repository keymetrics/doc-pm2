# Presentation

There are 2 types of overview in PM2 Plus, the first one is the `Application overview` where you don't see any reference to a server in the overview, this one is mainly useful to containers or environment with a lot of applications.
The other one is the `Server overview` which is the default with PM2 Plus, it's more detailed than the other one and show you every information by physical server.

## Server Overview

This view is breakdown by server, in the following example we have one server with 7 applications :

In the top bar of this section you will find infos about the actual server
- The Server's Name
- Number of cores and memory
- Versions of Node.js & PM2
- The public and private IP

You are able to get realtime infos about any application such as
- cpu utilization
- memory comsumption
- HTTP Latency
- Issues
- Event Loop Lag (the amount of time between two run of the event loop, should be less than 10 ms)
- Number of restarts
- Versionning metadata (if your app is in a git repository)

At the left of each application you can toggle more information for the application, it will show you :
- All the metrics about the applications (both default and custom ones)
- All the custom actions you added, you can trigger them for these buttons too.

## Apps Overview

![app overview](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/keymetrics/branding/screenshots/plus/overview/app_overview.png)

It contains almost everything you need to see to understand the current health of your applications :

- CPU Usage Heatmap
    - Each cell represent a process in a server
    - the color represent the cpu usage (varying from green to red where red is 100% of cpu usage)
- Error history
    - Last hour, last day and last week, it give you an idea if the application is instable for a long time or not.
- Important metrics
    - average cpu utilization
    - average memory consumption
    - average latency (only if you are using an http server) 
    - average Request / minutes (only if you are using an http server)

If you click on the heatmap, you will directly go on the app dashboad which is discribed in the following dashboard.
