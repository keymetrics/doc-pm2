Welcome to the Overview of <b>PM2 Plus</b>!
</center>

Once you go serious about production, you need to make sure that your application is running properly, without bugs, without performance issues and without downtimes.

That's why we created PM2 Plus. It's a set of features for both hardening your current PM2 Runtime Process manager and monitoring applications in production.

With PM2 Plus you get:

- A Real-time Monitoring Web Interface
- Issues & Exception Tracking
- Deployment reporting
- Realtime logs
- Email & Slack notifications
- Custom Metrics Monitoring
- Custom Actions Center

To start testing, you can either go to [app.pm2.io](https://app.pm2.io) or use the pm2 cli (pm2 above 3.2.7):

```bash
pm2 plus
```

## Features available in PM2 Plus

### Server overview

### Custom Actions

![remote action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keymetrics/branding/master/screenshots/plus/actionCenter/actionCenter.png)

PM2 Plus makes possible to enhance custom functions in the source code of your application.

For example, you can assign values to your application variables or just switch it to maintenance mode. In other words you can **expose triggerable functions in your code**.

You will to use the the [@pm2/io module](https://github.com/keymetrics/pm2-io-apm) comes along with PM2. It is the PM2 part responsible for gathering the metrics, reporting exceptions, exposing remote actions and every outside interaction with your application.

No need to ssh into your servers and use `pm2 logs` anymore, everything is on the web interface.
