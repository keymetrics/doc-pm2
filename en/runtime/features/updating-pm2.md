## Updating PM2

Updating PM2 is straightforward. Upgrading between minor and patch versions will **never** break anything on your environment

You will have to first run the installation command:

```bash
$ npm install pm2@lastest -g
```

Then to save your current process list, kill the previous PM2 daemon and restore process list with the new PM2 version is as easy as doing:

```bash
$ pm2 update
```
