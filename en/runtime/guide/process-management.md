# Process management

PM2 is a process kept in the background, a daemon, that takes care of all your running processes.

We'll learn how to manage process with PM2 and discover a key concept : the process list.

## The process list

The process list is where all running applications are registered.

Manage your process list in a few commands:

```bash
# start and add a process to your list
pm2 start app.js

# show your list
pm2 ls

# stop and delete a process from the list
pm2 delete app
```

When you use `pm2 start app.js`, two actions are performed:
- the app is registered in the process list of pm2
- the app is started in the background.

 Default name in the process list is the name of the script without his extension. Use `--name`or `-n` to change.

## Routine

Once setup your process list, every actions are done with the process name.

```bash
# kill the process but keep it in the process list
pm2 stop app

# start the process again
pm2 start app

# both stop and start
pm2 restart app
```

Multiple app can be specified at once:
```bash
pm2 restart app1 app2 app3
```

Or, shorter with a regexp:
```bash
pm2 restart /app/
```

## Save your process list

You can save and resurrect your process list with:

```bash
# save your list in hard disk memory
pm2 save

# resurrect your list previously saved
pm2 resurrect
```

 Your process list is saved into `$HOME/.pm2/dump.pm2`.

You can then setup a [startup hook]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/runtime/guide/startup-hook.md %}), to automatically start your process list through machine restarts.

## Manage any application type

pm2 is compatible with other programming languages, using this equivalence:

```json
{
  ".sh": "bash",
  ".py": "python",
  ".rb": "ruby",
  ".coffee": "coffee",
  ".php": "php",
  ".pl": "perl",
  ".js": "node"
}
```

 Without extension, the app is started as a binary file.

To start a script in python for example, use:

```bash
pm2 start echo.py
```

If you want to specify the path of an interpreter, specify it in your ecosystem file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "script",
    script: "./script.py",
    interpreter: "/usr/bin/python",
  }]
}
```

## Local Monitoring

![pm2 local monitoring]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link img/runtime/monit.png %})

The local monitoring tool get you insight about CPU usage, memory usage, loop delay or request/min for each process:

```bash
pm2 monit
```

Monitor your app on a web dashboard, with [PM2 Plus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/plus/quick-start.md %})
