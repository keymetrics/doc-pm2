# Using PM2 with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This page will guide you step by step through the PM2 integration in an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.

We will use Git and the Elastic Beanstalk CLI.

---

## Prepare your app

### Set your ecosystem file

Generate an `ecosystem.config.js` template with:

```bash
pm2 init
```

Change the template to suit your needs:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }]
}
```

?> Learn more about ecosystem file [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/runtime/guide/ecosystem-file.md %}).

### Add PM2 as a module

Add pm2 as a dependency to your projet.

With npm:

```bash
npm install --save pm2
```

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add pm2
```

### Set your package.json

In your `package.json`, modify the start script to:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "pm2-runtime start ecosystem.config.js --env production"
  }
```

## Deploy with Elastic Beanstalk CLI

### Create an account on AWS and get your access keys

Sign up for an account on AWS [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).

In order to get access keys, you must create an IAM user. You can do that [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home).

Add a user:

![create an IAM User]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link img/runtime/IAM-add.png %})

Give it the programmatic access:

![select programmatic access]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link img/runtime/IAM-prog.png %})

Select the `ElasticBeanstalkFullAccess` strategy:

![select programmatic access]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link img/runtime/IAM-strat.png %})

Create the user and you will get your access keys:

![access keys]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link img/runtime/IAM-creds.png %})

Copy and paste your `access-id` and your `secret-key` in your AWS config file (`~/.aws/config`):

```Vim
[profile eb-cli]
aws_access_key_id = YYYYYYYYYYYYY
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Install the CLI

The CLI is available with pip, the python package manager:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade --user awsebcli
```

?> Further instructions to install [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html).

### Init your Elastic Beanstalk app

Run `eb init -p Node.js` to initialize your Node.js app:

```bash
eb init --profile eb-cli -p Node.js

Select a default region
2) us-west-1 : US West (N. California)

Select an application to use
[ Create new Application ]

Enter Application Name
eb-pm2-example
Application eb-pm2-example has been created.

Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
(y/n): n
```

For a description of each option see the AWS example [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs_express.html)

### Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment

Each application can have many environments, which is useful to manage separate environments for development, testing or production.

Before creating an environment, make sure to commit your changes. The Elastic Beanstalk uses `git archive` to create a .zip file from the contents of the most recent git commit command.

To create a new environment, run the following:
```bash
eb create eb-pm2-example-env
```

List all available environments with:
```bash
eb list
eb-pm2-example-env
```

Get environment infos and status with:
```bash
eb status

Environment details for: eb-pm2-example-env
  Application name: eb-pm2-example
  Region: us-west-2
  Deployed Version: app-4408-180305
  Environment ID: e-gekedaw
  Platform: arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-west-1::platform/Node.js running on 64bit Amazon Linux/4.4.5
  Tier: WebServer-Standard-1.0
  CNAME: eb-pm2-example.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
  Updated: 2018-02-19 23:51:59.259000+00:00
  Status: Ready
  Health: Green
```


?> Later, to deploy latest changes, commit them and run `eb deploy <environment_name>` or just `eb deploy`.

## You are ready

That's all! Run `eb open` to open your app in the browser.

## Next step

Complete your configuration with the [Ecosystem File]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/runtime/guide/ecosystem-file.md %})

Monitor your app on a web dashboard, with [PM2 Plus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/plus/integration/elastic-beanstalk.md %})
